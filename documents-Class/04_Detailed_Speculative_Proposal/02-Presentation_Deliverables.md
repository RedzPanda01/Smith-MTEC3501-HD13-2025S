# 📌 MTEC 3501: March 10 Project Proposal Presentation – Deliverables  

## **Overview**  
The **March 10 Presentation** serves as a critical checkpoint where students will transition from **Research/Design** into **early Production planning**. Students must clearly define their project vision, research findings, production milestones, and **what their prototype will be** (even though it will not be built yet).  

---

## **📂 Required Deliverables**  
Students must submit the following **before** their March 10 presentation.

| **Category** | **Deliverable** | **Description** | **Submission Format** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| 🎤 **Oral Presentation (Main Deliverable)** | **10-minute project pitch** | A structured verbal presentation covering project scope, feasibility, research, milestones, and what the prototype will be. | **Live panel presentation (March 10, in-person)** |
| 📖 **Research & Precedents** | **Annotated Research Bibliography** | List of relevant research, inspirations, and technical references, stored in **Zotero** and linked in the proposal. | **Zotero Library (shared link in GitHub Issue)** |
| 📝 **Written Proposal** | **Refined Speculative Proposal (Climax + Prototype Plan)** | The core document outlining the full vision (**Climax**) and what the prototype will be. | **GitHub (Markdown file in "Projects" folder, student branch)** |
| 🏗 **Project Planning** | **Milestone & Issue Tracking in GitHub** | A structured breakdown of the project into **at least 3 milestones** and **5 GitHub issues** tied to phases. | **GitHub Project Board (Milestones & Issues tab)** |
| 🎥 **Presentation Slides** | **Google Slides or PDF Deck** | A concise, **visually structured presentation**, with examples and research references. | **Google Drive (in "Panel-1-Deliverables" folder), linked in GitHub Issue** |
| 🎯 **Prototype Plan** | **Description of the prototype (not built yet)** | A document explaining **what the prototype will be, its key functions, and what needs to be built first**. | **GitHub (Markdown file in "Prototype-Planning" folder)** |
| 🤖 **AI Usage Report** | **Brief summary of AI tools used** | A short write-up on any **AI tools** used in research, design, or planning, describing **how AI was used** and its impact. | **GitHub (Markdown file in "AI-Usage" folder)** |
| 🎯 **Self-Assessment & Feedback Reflection** | **Project Feasibility Summary** | A **300-500 word write-up** summarizing **project feasibility, challenges, and areas needing feedback**. | **GitHub (Markdown file in "Reflections" folder)** |

## **📊 Structure for the 10-Minute Presentation**  

Each student should structure their **oral presentation** following this flow:  

### **🔹 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)**
- **Project Name & One-Sentence Summary**  
- **Project Type** (game, installation, animation, AI tool, etc.)  
- **Goal of the project** and why it is important  

### **🔹 2. Research & Precedents (2-3 minutes)**
- **Key references, inspirations, and research findings**  
- **Technical or artistic precedents that inform the project**  
- **Personal past work** (if relevant) to show experience in this field  

### **🔹 3. Project Breakdown (3-4 minutes)**
- **Climax Version:** Full, ambitious vision of the project  
- **Prototype Plan:** What the prototype will be, what it will demonstrate, and the first steps toward building it  
- **Technical requirements & tools needed**  
- **Expected challenges or uncertainties**  

### **🔹 4. Milestones & Feasibility (2 minutes)**
- **Breakdown of key milestones in GitHub** (Research, Design, Produce, Publish, Assess)  
- **Estimated timeline and development strategy**  

### **🔹 5. Questions for Feedback (1 minute)**
- Areas where **feedback is needed** to refine the project  
- Any **uncertainties about execution, scope, or research**  

📌 **Timing Tip:** Ensure the presentation stays under **10 minutes** to allow for panel feedback.

## **📊 Milestone Breakdown for March 10**
Each student must structure their **GitHub milestones and issues** leading up to the March 10 presentation.  
Milestones should align with the **five project phases**:

1️⃣ **Milestone 1: Research & Proposal Finalization** *(Due by Feb 24)*  
   - Complete precedent & technical research.  
   - Refine speculative proposal (Climax & Prototype Plan).  
   - Identify **key assumptions, unknowns, and risks**.  

2️⃣ **Milestone 2: Structuring & Documentation** *(Due by March 3)*  
   - Define and document milestones in GitHub.  
   - Create **at least 5 issues** (tasks assigned to specific milestones).  
   - Set up GitHub repository with organized folders & README.  

3️⃣ **Milestone 3: Prototype Plan & Presentation Preparation** *(Due by March 7-9)*  
   - Define what the prototype will be and what needs to be built first.  
   - Finalize slides & proposal document.  
   - Prepare and practice the **10-minute presentation**.  
   - Write a self-reflection on **progress & challenges**.  
   - Document AI usage in research, design, or planning.
