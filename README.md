**Week 3 Assignments**

There are two major thrusts for this week's assignments.

1. Create a Speculative detailed proposal.  This does not have to be accurate, it just needs to be DETAILED.  If you have quesitons, don't worry, just put something down.
Here is a link to the [Detailed Assignment](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Detailed-Speculative-Proposal.md).
2. Create Milestones and Issues for your upcoming presentation on March 10.  You will also populate your Project with milestones and issues that will be needed to be completed in order to meet the goal of the presentation. [Milestone Assignment](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/03-Structuring_Milestones_for_Presentation.md).  A file that describes [how to create a milestone](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/03_ProjectTracking/Create_A_Milestone.md) can be found as well.

I created an example proposal and placed it into David B. Student's folder.   [Link](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/projects/David-Student/DBStudent-Clamorous%20ELF%20Detailed%20Speculative%20Proposal.md)  

Let me know if you have any questions!

**Week 3 Feb 10 WILL BE IN PERSON**

**Assignment Week 2 (Feb 3 - Feb 9)**  
Continue to work through the document [Student Brainstorming Guide](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/02_Brainstorming/02_Student_Brainstorming_Guide.md)   
Specifically, 
[2c. Forced Juxtaposition](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/02_Brainstorming/02_Student_Brainstorming_Guide.md#c-forced-juxtaposition-github-discussions)  
Everyone will respond to each discussion with additional connections.  You should provide at least two per discussion.  

[2d. "Kill Your Idea"](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-HD13-2025S/blob/main/documents-Class/02_Brainstorming/02_Student_Brainstorming_Guide.md#d-kill-your-idea-test-github-pull-requests)  
This time we will do the collaboration as a Pull request, and all participants will comment with potential solutions as well.  

Note that after each of these, continue to refine your concept Idea.  This will be written into a version 2 for your project idea.

This GitHub repository will manage and store activities within MTEC 3501.  Each student will have their own folder within which to place their documentation and products, and each student will also be assigned a Project in which we can manage your materials.  All research materials used as background will be placed into Zotero. The Wiki will hold additional information.
