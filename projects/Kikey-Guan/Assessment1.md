# Feedback Report for Kikey

## Reviewer: Adam Wilson
**Project Title:** Desktop Pals

### Strengths
You have a strong concept and overall theme.

### Areas for Improvement
More specificity needs to be given to the interstitial games (spelling, etc.) and to the specifics of user interaction.  These should be written down (in words and pictures/diagrams) and not just remain in your head; imagine you are a project manager writing a spec for some designers and programmers who will them implement your ideas without your intervention.

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Neutral
- Clear Execution Plan: Neutral
- Challenges Identified: Agree
- Technical Foundation: Neutral
- Creative Foundation: Strongly Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Agree
- Originality: Agree
- Future Development: Strongly Agree

### AI Integration
AI is unnecessary.

### Final Comments
I think your "maximal" idea of having creatures leave their "frames" and invade the desktop is one of the most exciting/entertaining ideas you have. Explore this, even if it has to wait until after you complete your culmination class project.

### Overall Evaluation
Approve with Minor Revisions

**Project Title:** Desktop Pals

### Strengths
I really like this idea as a culmination project. It has a flexible scope that you can constrict or expand as needed. I believe the features you presented are all feasible, but as I mentioned during your presentation, the fact that this 'Pal' lives on your desktop suggests to me that some form of interactivity with the user's desktop should be a priority feature. Not just because the game is called 'Desktop pals', but also because this can be your differentiating factor. As in the thing the makes your game different than the vast majority of virtual pet, cozy games out there. You can start small with desktop interaction, you don't need to do major things. In fact I think your best bet is small strategic choices that 'break the 4th wall' in little ways. The effect will often be greater than the sum of its parts. For example, it is quite easy for Unity to access things from your system such as time, date, platform, OS, microphone, volume level, mouse activity and small things like that. If you can use this data to do stuff in your game that relate to these things. For example the pet can react to sound you're listening to or the time of day or whether you're typing or not...little things like that. things that are not that hard to implement but that can a lot of value in the aggregate. 
We can talk about this more if you're interested - both from a design perspective and to discuss how these things could be implemented. 

### Areas for Improvement
I think your presentation lacked some specificity in key areas that could have helped better explain your plan to the panelists. I got a good idea of what you're trying to do but mostly because I'm quite familiar with these types of games and have advised students doing similar virtual pet projects in the past. What could have helped is either:
A- more high fidelity sketches (maybe even some photoshop/illustrator/AI mock-ups of what the interface might look like on the desktop). 
B- A more elaborate list of specifications and features you're planning.
C- A more fleshed out task list so we (and you) get a better understanding of the work required. 
D- A visual style sample (so like for example how will the game visuals be rendered?  pixel-art? hand-drawn art? 3D ? ) You don't need to have necessarily committed to a style per se, but giving us an idea of your thoughts here can clue us in to your process more and give us a better sense of what you're planning .

### Final Comments
Finally, just to summarize everything above. I really like this project choice and believe you have the artistic, creative and technical ability to pull it off. Just keep in mind that we're all here to support you so don't hesitate to reach out with questions or even if you just want to bounce your ideas off someone.

### Overall Evaluation
Strongly Approve (Excellent Proposal)

**Project Title:** Desktop Pals

### Strengths
Overall concept clear and strong, clear precedent examples / inspiration, well-prepped presentation.

### Areas for Improvement
Need much more detailed production timeline in order to asses feasibility and scope. For mini-games, how many? What are they? What is involved in making them? What is involved in making the assets? 1-2 weeks for each interactive activity: unable to assess this feasibility without more details. Create a new production timeline with more detailed task breakdown and dates for milestones, from now through the end of culmination semester. Include your technical prototype plan for this semester.

For originality / innovation (as asked below), I am not yet sure how this project departs from precedent projects like Tamagotchi. I want to understand more clearly what is more "Kikey" about this project, what she is offering differently. I think there's a lot of room for original, creative contribution, and I think Kikey is thinking about this, but I am just not sure on the details yet. They need to be further articulated to us.

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Neutral
- Clear Execution Plan: Disagree
- Challenges Identified: Neutral
- Technical Foundation: Neutral
- Creative Foundation: Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Neutral
- Originality: Neutral
- Future Development: Agree

### AI Integration
I do not remember mention of AI or citation of AI in the presentation.

### Final Comments
I think this is a really fun project, with a lot of room and flexibility for creative contribution and technical challenge. I just need to see this more detailed out and articulated in terms of the production plan. For that reason I am selecting "signifiant revision" below. I otherwise think the project idea is strong. 

### Overall Evaluation
Needs Significant Revision
