# Feedback Report for Jessica

## Reviewer: Allison Berkoy
**Project Title:** AI-Driven Smart Plant Monitoring

### Strengths
A lot of prep work, research, and pre-production. Strong foundation to build on, with the 2280 project already complete. Lays out the large vision. 

### Areas for Improvement
It was great to hear about the large (maximal) vision, as well as the research/brainstorm for software/hardware possibilities-- but we spent so much time in the max vision and research, we were getting a bit lost for what the Culmination project might be. For a long time I was not sure if the project was about agriculture or house plants. I suggest making the project elevator pitch quickly and clearly at the outset, so we have more context as we learn more. 

Overall, think of this project as rolling out in versions, adding additional features with subsequent versions. What are the most critical features to include in the Culmination version?

I recommend: choose one house plant to focus on (basil?), research the optimal conditions it needs and select up to three sensors to measure data relating to the specific needs of that particular plant. Focus on the pot design, how sensors and the microcontroller get embedded, the interface, the communication between devices. This alone is a huge project, if moving through multiple iterations and getting to a polished version for presentation. 

Consider further-- what makes this plant care system more "Jessica" than what is already out there? What is most important to you here? Is it the physical design? The digital interface? Cute animations? Plant education? Choose ONE aspect that you really want to push and prioritize here as your calling card.

As a future feature, AI might be a great add, but I strongly recommend it as a future feature, not for Culmination. There are so many other aspects here to focus on, rather than spreading so thin. 

When scoring feasibility below, I am basing this on the original project plan, which feels over-scoped and unwieldy for the timeframe. With a re-scope, I have full confidence in your execution of this project.

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Disagree
- Clear Execution Plan: Disagree
- Challenges Identified: Agree
- Technical Foundation: Agree
- Creative Foundation: Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Agree
- Originality: Agree
- Future Development: Strongly Agree

### AI Integration
I do not remember mention of AI use in preparing the proposal or presentation

### Final Comments
I am selecting "needs significant revision" below as there needs to be a big rethink on the scope, features, and overall production plan. This otherwise is a strong project idea. I'd like to see a solid plan by the end of the semester, with all hardware and software selected, and with a detailed task breakdown with milestones through the end of the Culmination semester. Let's discuss what you will work on for this semester's technical prototype-- this should be guided by the aspect you most want to prioritize (physical pot design, digital interface, animations, etc). Ian Pokorny is another great resource to touch base with as you continue to think some of this through.

**Project Title:** Smart Plant Monitoring System

### Strengths
I think this is a great idea for an emerging media culmination project as it demonstrates various technical challenges and how physical computing can be applied to achieve a specific, user-centric function. I also appreciate your ambition with regards to how it can scaled and developed further, integrating mobile app development as well as AI driven solutions to maximize its utility. You also demonstrated that you have both the drive and the ability to implement your ideas by showing us your earlier prototype. 

### Areas for Improvement
You got this feedback already but it is worth emphasizing that, while it is great that you're being ambitious with this project, its sort of a balancing act. Being too ambitious can put the project out of the plausible scope achievable in the timeframe you're faced with. 
I think you got some good advice on this front, namely to put aside the AI part for now (or at the very least scale its role down significantly). Basically you already have a lot going on and a lot on your plate as is with fabricating the physical module and making sure the functionality that you have is implemented well and relatively bug-free. That is not even mentioning your plan to create a mobile app which is, in and of itself, a culmination project on its own. I don't think there is anything wrong with scaling the project down a notch and really thinking about your main objective is with this project. For example, is the mobile app a necessary component for the minimum viable product? Or is it part of the larger vision for what this prototype can become?   

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Neutral
- Clear Execution Plan: Agree
- Challenges Identified: Agree
- Technical Foundation: Strongly Agree
- Creative Foundation: Strongly Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Strongly Agree
- Originality: Strongly Agree
- Future Development: Strongly Agree

### AI Integration
 

### Final Comments
As I already mentioned, I really like this project and think you can pull it off, especially if you scope it down a notch. I also wanted to add that, I really like that you are essentially making a smart-pot for a plant, in that you are integrating the electronic components into the pot itself.  When I was a kid, I would spend my summer at my grandmother's house and on her balcony she always had a lot of plants (which I wasn't allowed to touch for the reasons i brought up in class :) ) and I was always struck how she didn't use conventional pots but instead this large commercial powdered milk 'Nido' tins. Which I later found out was a pretty common practice. I mention this because I think it is interesting to think about the form of your product as well as its function. Which is to say you can experiment with what a plant pot even is and how it can be re-imagined.  Not just as a casing for a plant and your components but perhaps something more interesting. I'll leave you with that thought.   

### Overall Evaluation
Strongly Approve (Excellent Proposal)

**Project Title:** AI-Driven Smart Plant Monitoring System

### Strengths
This project builds on an abundance of prior physical computing experience and app development.  That is *exactly* what a culmination project should do.

### Areas for Improvement
Reduce the scope massively. That doesn't mean abandon your ideas -- just put them off until after the culmination project course. The course should be the minimal prototype of your system; you can spend as long as you like in the future bolting onto it. Your idea to train a deep learning network to predict plant disease is out of scope; as I mentioned, this is a computational biology Ph.D thesis (maybe you should consider getting a Ph.D in computational biology).

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Disagree
- Clear Execution Plan: Agree
- Challenges Identified: Agree
- Technical Foundation: Agree
- Creative Foundation: Strongly Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Agree
- Originality: Agree
- Future Development: Strongly Agree

### AI Integration
AI is not needed, but could be applied in future iterations if the data is available.

### Final Comments
I really like your focus here -- keep it up!  You can make a great career studying the environment. I recommend grad school in this area.

### Overall Evaluation
Approve with Minor Revisions
