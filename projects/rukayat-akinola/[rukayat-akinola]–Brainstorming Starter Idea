Idea Overview
Describe your project idea in 2-3 sentences.

My culmination project is a hopefully a polished animation demo reel to jumpstart a career, technical directing in animation. I haven’t decided on content and plan to research and consume many animation reels out there for inspirations on content. They’re are also demo reel best practices I’m yet to document but will be the benchmarks the eventually product adheres to.
