# Feedback Report for Rukayat

## Reviewer: Adam Wilson
**Project Title:** Animation Demo Reel

### Strengths
This presents an interesting hybrid take on static comic-book style animation and video animation.

### Areas for Improvement
The consensus seems that you need to find a way forward through the technical aspects of your project, including making decisions about whether you will focus mostly on 2D or 3D, whether you will borrow assets to rig or perhaps design some of your own assets, and what software to use for this (this decision will be dependent on your decisions on the latter two points).  Scope should probably be reduced to one animation instead of three.

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Neutral
- Clear Execution Plan: Disagree
- Challenges Identified: Neutral
- Technical Foundation: Neutral
- Creative Foundation: Agree

### Potential Impact & Innovation
- Contribution to Field: Strongly Agree
- Originality: Strongly Agree
- Future Development: Strongly Agree

### AI Integration
AI is unnecessary for implementation.

### Final Comments
Rukayat - I am sorry, but I was unable to identify the student whose culmination project involved making 3D assets in Blender. It was many years ago. However, I think among the software suggestions provided by Prof. Smith and Prof. Auji, you should be able to find a way forward without outsourcing work to another human (but with some outsourcing to various software resources).

**Project Title:** Animation Industry Standard Demo Reel

### Strengths
Well prepped presentation, does a great job in educating us on key animation concepts and project goals, lots of pre-production work already complete on first sketch idea, strong conceptual ideas for sketch 1 design. 

### Areas for Improvement
Rather than a demo reel of multiple sketches, I strongly recommend focusing on a single animation. Conceptual ideas very strong-- technical implementation still in a gray area. Perhaps largest challenge right now is in figuring out source of assets? I recommend discussing questions and prelim plan with your current animation prof and asking for further recommendations of profs in COMD with animation expertise. As I mentioned, I very much worry about the 6.5 out of 10 level of excitement! What needs to change to get this to a 9.5-10? If you are not finding this space, we need to consider a more radical change in the project. Otherwise it does not make sense to invest so much time and energy here.

For Feasibility and execution below, these are scored with the original proposal in mind, of creating a 3-sketch reel. I believe a 1-sketch project is much more feasible.

### Feasibility and Execution
- Scope Realistic: Disagree
- Clear Execution Plan: Disagree

### AI Integration
I do not remember use of AI mentioned or cited in the presentation

### Final Comments
Again, lots of great ideas here. Need to get the tech pipeline figured out, along with a detailed production timeline with milestones and dates. Tech prototype due for the end of this semester also needs to be identified.

Discuss asset sourcing with COMD profs and others. Is a collaborator feasible for some assets? (Would need to identify this person right away if so.) Is AI feasible for some assets?

I promised to pass along a few things...

If you'd like to check out some of my past, strange work...

This is a music video for Roberto Carlos Lange (aka Epstein / Helado Negro). This is all 2d key-frame animation, collaging and animating multiple video layers. Combo of Final Cut Pro, After Effects, and video processing with analog video synthesizers.

This is a documentary art/science project that I edited and animated. Again, all key-frame animation. The assets are mostly static 2d, a combo of found images and original illustrations (created by a collaborator). Some key-framed video layering in this too. Final Cut and After Effects. Trigger warning: some of the content is graphic, including a lot of poop and a colonoscopy.

This is one of my favorite artists using Cinema 4D for video animations and sculptures:

I had also mentioned Don Hertzfeldt, one of my favorite 2d animators, master of expressive stick figures. This is part of a feature length animated film called "It's Such a Beautiful Day." Somehow his stick figures will make me weep.

Explore more references for use of diptych and split screen. 

Below, I am selecting "significant revision" as there's still a lot to figure out here. I think you are on the right path if you can find a modified plan (with re-scope and clear pipeline) that improves your excitement level. If not finding that excitement, I think this all needs a major rethink!

**Project Title:** Animation Reel Demo Project

### Strengths
The entire concept is strong.  Very thoughtful ideas that make this a unique approach to a reel.  

### Areas for Improvement
I would like to have an image or something at the very top that better describes the "look and feel " of the reel based on this material.  You may wish to look at some applications such as Daz Studio:  which is free and you can get base characters and manipulate them quite simply.  https://www.daz3d.com/.  Here is a pregnant morph target for one otf the Daz characters https://forum.daz3d.com/signs-of-pregnancy-for-genesis-8.

## Reviewer: Hosni Auji
**Project Title:** Animation Project 

### Strengths
I think your core idea for a comic book panel inspired animation featuring different techniques is smart and has legs. I also appreciate how you've started planning, sketching testing things like editing 3D meshes to see if that particular idea works. I feel this process needs to continue because I'm not quite sure you've found the methodology that will work for your needs yet. That's okay because that is what this pre-production phase is for. You want to make sure what you're planning is feasible and that it will get you to where you want to go (see the next comment for my thoughts on that). 

### Areas for Improvement
Right now I still feel there is an open question with regards of how best to realize this animation idea. Judging from your presentation, I suspect you feel the same way. Again, that is fine because that is what this process is for, to figure out how best to tackle the challenges ahead. I have already highlighted some of the issues with 3D humanoid animation and the importance of starting out with a good mesh and a good rig. If you have the assets to make this work then the keyframe animation process, while arduous, is definitely doable. The problem is finding these assets, namely a rigged pregnant woman that you can animate (the doctor might be easier to find). However, even if you find both, they would need to be of a similar visual style which is an additional challenge to boot. My recommendation is to consider a different approach. Don't scrap the 3D idea entirely but consider other options. Try out things like cut-out animation (see Terry Gilliam animations as an example - they are weird and quirky but also kinda cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMpXUd_kesA&ab_channel=TheMontyPythonMuseum) or stop-motion animation (with dolls maybe?) or something else. Animation history is filled with examples of 'economical animations' such as creating motion from still images. The example that comes to mind is how some low-budget 80s japanese anime tried to create animation with as little frames as possible. They would pan still images and recycle the same 3 or 4 frames of a character because that is all they could afford to do. You don't have to do that exactly but I suppose the point is, they tried to do a lot with a little. What I'm trying to get at is, you don't need to adopt the Pixar method of high-fidelity smooth 3D animation, you can be more stylistic in your approach and I think the comic book panel idea you have allows for this kind of approach. Still images with a panning camera and comic panels scaling. You can also consider rotoscoping (where you take actual video and export that video to frames and then trace over them or composite visuals on top of them. see some examples here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRQbrpNjQWY&ab_channel=InnocentRobot ).  I would take a bit more time experimenting with other techniques before committing to a single style, you might stumble on something you like or you might decide that you want to stick to 3D in which case you can focus your energy on making it work, even if you need to amend your synopsis a bit.

### Final Comments
Basically to summarize, if your main goal is to produce a 3D animation then perhaps amending your script to fit workable assets you have access to can be a solution (if you don't find what you're looking for). Alternatively, if want to animate your current scenario and are not married to 3D animation per se, consider alternative approaches like cut-out animation or rotoscoping. Do tests, find an approach that A- Looks cool. B- Is something you know you can pull off or at the very least something you are excited to try and pull off. C- Takes into account your current timeframe and resources. If you find a technique that hits all these notes, then it's game on!
