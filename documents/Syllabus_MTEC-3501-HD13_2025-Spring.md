### COURSE DESCRIPTION  

Students dedicate three classroom hours and six independent study hours per week to begin the process of producing a capstone project, suitable for use as a portfolio item in applications for graduate school or professional employment. Projects may be undertaken individually or in small groups. Students develop their ideas, research prior art, break down proposed work into a sequence of executable components with estimated times-to-completion, iterate through prototypes, and document their work. This course is a prerequisite for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, in which students finalize and present the work begun in Culmination Project Development. Ideally, students will take the two courses consecutively, as this should be considered a single year long initiative that transcends the boundaries of the semester.

### Lesson Plan: The Value of Speculation

**Class Title:** MTEC 3501 - Culmination Project Development  
**Week 1 Topic:** Introduction to Speculative Thinking  
**Duration:** 90 minutes (lecture and activities)  

---

### **Objective:**
By the end of this session, students will:
- Understand the concept and value of speculative thinking.
- Identify how speculation leads to innovative and forward-thinking ideas.
- Begin documenting speculative ideas in a design document.
- Recognize the different speculative needs of students who already have a project idea versus those still exploring.

---

### **Class Breakdown:**

#### **1. Introduction (10 minutes)**
- **Lecture:**
  - Define speculative thinking: “Speculation is the imaginative exploration of possibilities without the immediate constraints of feasibility.”
  - Discuss its role in creativity, innovation, and technology.
  - Highlight examples of speculation in technology and media:
    - Speculative design in science fiction influencing real-world technology (e.g., Star Trek’s communicator to smartphones).
    - Architects and designers imagining future cities with sustainable technology.
  - Explain how speculation differs from traditional problem-solving: the focus is on imagining the future rather than addressing current challenges.

- **Key Points:**
  - Speculation fosters creativity and innovation.
  - It allows students to take risks and explore unconventional ideas.
  - Early-stage documentation is crucial to capture ideas for refinement later.

---

#### **2. Discussion: The Value of Speculation (15 minutes)**
- Pose these questions to the class and facilitate an open discussion:
  1. Why do you think speculation is important in the development of new ideas?
  2. How might speculative thinking differ for someone with a defined project idea versus someone still exploring?
  3. Can you think of examples where speculative thinking has led to groundbreaking innovations?

- **Activity:**
  - Break the class into small groups (3-4 students each).
  - Ask each group to identify one speculative idea they find exciting (from media, technology, etc.) and discuss how it might apply to their own projects.

---

#### **3. Speculative Design Activity: Brainstorming Futures (30 minutes)**
- **Activity Objective:** Generate multiple speculative ideas for potential projects or enhancements to existing ideas.

- **Instructions:**
  1. Students pair up or work individually.
  2. Use the following prompts to brainstorm and sketch ideas:
     - What will this industry or technology look like in 5, 10, or 20 years?
     - What problems might humanity face in the future, and how can technology/media address them?
     - How can emerging tools like AI, AR, VR, or holography redefine how we experience the world?
  3. Each student generates at least 3 ideas and captures them in their design document.

---

#### **4. Introducing the Design Document (20 minutes)**
- **Lecture:**
  - Explain the purpose of the design document:
    - A living document to capture ideas, refine concepts, and document the development process.
    - Include speculative elements as starting points.
  - Overview of structure:
    - Title and Summary of the idea.
    - Concept sketches, diagrams, or brief descriptions.
    - Notes on potential feasibility, applications, and challenges.

- **Activity:**
  - Students begin drafting their design document based on the ideas generated during brainstorming.
  - Encourage creativity and stress that refinement comes later; for now, no idea is too ambitious or impractical.

---

#### **5. Wrap-Up and Reflection (15 minutes)**
- **Discussion:**
  - What challenges did you face during the brainstorming session?
  - How did speculative thinking help you generate new ideas?
  - How do you think this process will influence your approach to project development?

- **Assignment:**
  - Continue working on your design document and expand upon the speculative ideas discussed in class.
  - Prepare to share one speculative concept and its potential application in next week’s session.

---

### **Materials Needed:**
- Whiteboard or digital collaboration tool (e.g., Miro, Jamboard).
- Design document template (provided digitally or in print).
- Sketching tools (physical or digital).

## COURSE STRUCTURE  
This course combines lecture/presentation, lab/studio, and discussion/critique. In preparation for ENT 4501 Culmination Project, you will move through iterative phases of project proposal development, including brainstorming, ideation, research, rapid prototyping, and presentation. 

You will receive robust feedback along the way from your peers, your course instructor, and additional faculty. At midterm, you will present your project proposal to a panel of faculty for feedback. At the end of the semester, you will present a prototype / proof of concept to a second panel of faculty, for additional feedback. Your are encouraged to also take advantage of faculty office hours, meeting with faculty who have expertise in particular areas of your project, for technical questions and further advisement. 

Weekly assignments will be posted to our GitHub wiki on Mondays, generally due the following Monday, to further assist your project development. This will consist of short readings and media viewings, reflections, and process documentation milestones. 

Note that our course will operate in hybrid modality, in a mix of in-person sessions and synchronous Zoom sessions. See our schedule below for the modality of each session.  


## GRADING   
**COURSE GRADING**     
Participation 20%    
Weekly assignments 25%     
Midterm proposal presentation and deliverables 25%   
Final presentation and deliverables 30%   
  
      
Participation will be graded out of 3 points:     
3 = full participation: fully present for class activity, on task, and supportive of classmates throughout the class session.   
2 = partial participation: late arrival or early departure from class activity, on task for some of the time.   
1 = minimal participation: absent from class activity for more than 30 minutes, minimally on task.    
0 = no participation.    
  
**Late policy:** Every effort must be made to turn work in on time, as it will otherwise put your project behind, while making it difficult or impossible for receiving adequate feedback. It will also impact your ability to fully engage in class activities and support your peers.  On a case by case basis, in consultation with the instructor, late deliverables may be accepted for a 10% drop in the grade for each week it is late. In certain extenuating circumstances (such as a serious emergency), the late deduction may be waved. If there is an emergency preventing your ability to work or present, please contact your professor. Panelist critiques, if missed, cannot be made up.      


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY
Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the College recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalogue.

## INCLUSIVITY 
Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage 
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
